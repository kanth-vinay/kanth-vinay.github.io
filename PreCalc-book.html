    <p><strong>Offered by Active Learning Institute | Mentored by Prof. Vinay Kodipelly</strong></p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Why This Program Stands Out</h3>
      <p>This isn't just another summer math class — this is a chance to <strong>get published</strong>, build a <strong>high-impact portfolio project</strong>, and work directly with a university professor on a one-of-a-kind academic initiative. You'll be mastering Pre-Calculus while learning how to explain it clearly, professionally typeset it, and make it accessible for others.</p>
      <p><strong class="highlight">The "Eastern Way" Advantage:</strong> Our unique approach bridges the often-missed depth in traditional U.S.-based pre-calculus and algebra courses. Drawing on robust algebraic traditions and problem-solving methodologies from India (NCERT), Singapore, the UK (GCSE), and Europe, this program will introduce you to rapid problem-solving methods, creative algebraic identities, and over <strong class="highlight">200+ carefully curated non-routine puzzles and challenging problems</strong>. You’ll develop deeper conceptual understanding and versatile thinking for advanced STEM studies.</p>

      <h3>Program Structure</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>8 Weeks | Self-Paced Learning Modules | Asynchronous with Personalized Mentorship</strong></li>
        <li>Curriculum enriched with 200+ problems from international sources (NCERT, GCSE, Singaporean).</li>
        <li>Focus on rapid problem-solving, creative algebraic identities, and non-routine puzzles.</li>
        <li>Additional mentorship, feedback, and technical guidance throughout the program.</li>
        <li>Only <strong>8 highly motivated students</strong> accepted per cohort.</li>
        <li>Application required with interview for selection.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="info-box">
        <strong>Eligibility:</strong> Best suited for students who have completed Algebra II and are prepared for Pre-Calculus or beyond (rising 10th–12th grade). Strong math curiosity, commitment, and a willingness to write and revise are essential.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Asynchronous & Self-Paced:</strong> This program is fully asynchronous. Students work through all modules at their own pace, with ongoing guidance and feedback from the mentor, while authoring a chapter for the collaborative textbook.<br>
        <br>
        This is a serious commitment. If you're applying to competitive colleges or STEM programs, this is a major way to stand out — not just another extracurricular.

      <h3>Program Roadmap & Curriculum: An 8-Week Intensive Journey</h3>
      <p>
        This 8-week curriculum represents a recommended pace for mastering the full Pre-Calculus curriculum and developing your authored chapter, but students may proceed as fits their schedule. All students will learn the complete curriculum while developing one authored chapter as a capstone. Each week, you will dive into core Pre-Calculus concepts using <strong class="highlight">"The Eastern Way"</strong> approach (engaging with challenging problems from international curricula), simultaneously develop your technical writing skills in LaTeX and Markdown, and actively work on creating and typesetting your chapter for our collaborative HTML textbook. This is a hands-on, project-driven learning environment.
