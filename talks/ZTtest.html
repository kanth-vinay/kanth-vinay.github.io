                <h3>Scenario 1: Test of Average Commute Time</h3>
                <p>A city planner is interested in determining whether the average commute time in the city has increased from the long-established average of 30 minutes. She collects a random sample of 35 commute times from residents across various neighborhoods. In previous studies conducted by the Department of Transportation, extensive data on commute times were collected over many years, providing a wealth of information for analysis. The planner believes this data may help in her analysis of the new average.</p>

                <h4>Answer and Explanation:</h4>
                <p>This scenario uses a z-test since there is an indication that the population standard deviation is known (implied by previous studies and existing data). The sample size is also large (n > 30), which further supports the use of a z-test.</p>

                <p>A nutritionist wants to investigate whether the average daily caloric intake of adults in a rural region has shifted from the recommended 2,000 calories. She randomly selects 15 individuals and records their caloric intake. She notices that this population tends to have irregular meal patterns, and she does not have any previous detailed records about caloric intake from this region. However, the intake data she gathers appears somewhat skewed.</p>

                <p>This scenario calls for the Wilcoxon’s test. The sample size is small (n < 30), the data is skewed, and there’s no prior information about the population distribution or standard deviation, indicating that a non-parametric test like Wilcoxon’s would be suitable.</p>

                <p>A meteorologist suspects that the winter temperatures in a specific mountainous region have dropped below the historical average of 32°F due to climate change. Over a period of two months, she records a random sample of 50 daily temperatures. The region has been extensively studied by climate scientists for decades, and a large dataset exists on temperature patterns. She uses this data to compare current temperatures with historical values.</p>

                <p>A teacher is curious whether her class of 8 students performed better than the national average on a standardized math exam, where the national average score is reported to be 70. The teacher observes some variability in her students’ performance and notes that they do not seem to follow a strict pattern in their scores. However, the scores come from a high-achieving class that tends to skew higher than average.</p>

                <p>A doctor is concerned that the average systolic blood pressure of her patients may be higher than the healthy benchmark of 120 mmHg. She collects data from a sample of 25 patients who are all on the same treatment plan. While her hospital has been collecting data on blood pressure for years, the distribution of blood pressure readings in her small group of patients seems to vary more than expected.</p>

                <p>A large company is reviewing its employee salaries to determine if they are paying above the industry standard of $50,000 per year. A random sample of 40 employees is chosen from different departments across the company. The company has access to historical salary data from its HR department, as it has been tracking salaries for many years and knows how salaries fluctuate over time.</p>

                <p>A car manufacturer claims that their new model achieves a fuel efficiency of 25 miles per gallon (mpg) or better. To test this, 10 cars are randomly selected, and their fuel efficiency is measured. The manufacturer has previously conducted fuel efficiency tests on earlier models, but the new model’s performance may differ from historical data.</p>

                <h4>Answer and Explanation:</h4>
                <p>A t-test is appropriate here. The sample size is small (n < 30), and although there’s historical data, it might not fully apply to the new model’s performance, so we can’t assume the population standard deviation is known.</p>

                <p>A pharmaceutical company is interested in determining whether a new medication lowers blood pressure by more than the current standard treatment. They collect a sample of 20 patients who are administered the new medication. Previous studies on other medications have been done, but the new medication is expected to behave differently.</p>

                <h4>Answer and Explanation:</h4>
                <p>A t-test is appropriate here since the sample size is relatively small (n < 30) and the medication is new, so the population standard deviation is not known.</p>
